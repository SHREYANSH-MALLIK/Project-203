# socket.socket(address family , socket type)

# address family is the family of addresses that the socket can communicate with. Classic
# examples of 2 of the most famous address families are IPv4 and IPv6.
# AF_INET represents IPv4 while AF_INET6 represents IPv6.
# AF_INET is also the default value of the first argument, if not provided. Thatâ€™s because
# IPv4 is still widely used while IPv6 is relatively new.

# we are using SOCK_STREAM. It is the default value (if not provided) and it
# is used to create a TCP Socket. We could also use SOCK_DGRAM which is used to
# create a UDP Socket, however use of it case specific.
